The series is notable for being the first one in which the main character came out as gay, which DeGeneres' character did in the 1997 episode \"Puppy Episode\". This event received a great deal of media exposure, ignited controversy, and prompted ABC to place a parental advisory at the beginning of each episode.\n\nThe series' theme song, \"So Called Friend\" is by Scottish band Texas. A running gag was that each episode had a distinct opening credits sequence, resulting from Ellen's ongoing search for the perfect opening credits."

The \"Where's Waldo?\" TV Show brought the gangly man in the striped shirt and ski cap to Saturday morning TV. The cartoon \"Where's Waldo?\" went beyond the books' original concept, giving the characters depth and giving reasons for their adventures.\n\nWaldo and his dog Woof travel to distant lands, solving mysteries and lending a helping hand wherever they could. With the help of his magic walking stick, Waldo could travel through space and time or travel to far off magical lands. Often sent by Wizard Whitebeard to help solve a puzzle, or mysteries, \"Where's Waldo\" was a 1\/2 hour puzzle of clues and riddles.\n\nThe evil Waldo lookalike Odlaw was the show's villain, constantly plotting to steal Waldo's magic stick. In each episode Odlaw would team up with the other villains from the far-off lands to help get the magic stick, while Waldo and Woof teamed up with other land's \"good-guys\" to help with their problems."

In addition, TV presenter Keely Shaye Smith and actress Virginia Madsen contributed greatly to its success. Keely Shaye played the role of a reporter from the confines of an office interacting with Stack and responding to questions for further information. In this capacity, she was a welcomed addition to the cast and revered tremendously by Stack, who would \"cut to\" her for more detailed information. Academy-award-winning actress Virginia Madsen's contribution to the show included performing in Stack's role as announcer for several years. It was broadcast first as specials in 1987, then as a regular series on NBC, CBS, Lifetime and Spike. Lifetime once again airs the revived version of the series, but only in reruns.\n\nAlthough the show is not in current production, Cosgrove-Meurer Productions maintains a website for the show, featuring popular accounts and still unsolved crimes, with a link to an online form should a viewer have information on an unsolved crime."
